A series of terminal control sequence experiments in PHP
========================================================

Just some fun experimentations to research into the ANSI/VT100 terminal control
escape sequences, perhaps looking at some of the XTerm control sequences to see
what magic can be done there (getting mouse position etc.). Perhaps without the
use of an extension, who knows!

Early days yet, it will play 'Another one bites the dust' using the ASCII bell
at the moment (fun).

To launch the experiments so far, simply execute:

    php run.php
